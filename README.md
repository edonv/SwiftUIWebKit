## To-Do's

- [ ] Finish implementing `WKBackForwardList`
- [ ] Add access to more properties and functionality like `themeColor` and printing/PDF generation.
- [ ] Implement final implementations of UIDelegate callbacks for things like javascript alerts and panels
- [ ] Implement a final Share function to the Delegate that presents a sheet. maybe it has parameters or an enum parameter dictating what exactly and how its shared?
